# Pokemon-Damage-Calculator-


This is a rudementary damage calculator used to simulate an attack during a battle from the famous Nintendo franchise Pokemon. The formula I used was taken directly from the pokemon games with a few variables stripped away for a more practical application. This project was done as an exercise in the use of mathematical formulas in programs, basic graphical user interface design, and connecting back-end to front-end in a project.
